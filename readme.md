# Sharp7Monitor

Ever needed a simple console program to read some variables from a Siemens S7 PLC?

![alt text](docs/images/execute%20s7mon.gif?raw=true "run s7mon.exe demo")

Sharp7Monitor is a .NET Console program written in C# that connects to a Siemens S7 PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) and reads specified variables.
It displays the variable values in a table format directly in your console. The content of these variables is automatically updated.

## Usage

 - Download the zip file for your plattform from [releases](https://github.com/Peter-B-/Sharp7.Monitor/releases/latest):
   
   - [Windows x64](https://github.com/Peter-B-/Sharp7.Monitor/releases/latest/download/s7mon.win-x64.zip) - If you are not sure what to download, this is most likely what you need.
   - [Windows Arm 64](https://github.com/Peter-B-/Sharp7.Monitor/releases/latest/download/s7mon.win-arm64.zip)
   - [Linux x64](https://github.com/Peter-B-/Sharp7.Monitor/releases/latest/download/s7mon.linux-x64.zip)
   - [Linux Arm 64](https://github.com/Peter-B-/Sharp7.Monitor/releases/latest/download/s7mon.linux-arm64.zip)
 
 - Extract the `s7mon.exe`, resp. `s7mon` binary.

   The binaries are self contained - no installation of .Net Runtime is required.
  
    

 - Run the following command:
   ```powershell
   .\s7mon.exe <IP_Address> <Variable1> <Variable2> ... <VariableN>
   ```
   Replace `<IP_Address>` with the IP address of your Siemens S7 PLC, and list the desired variables (e.g., `DB2050.Byte1`, `DB2050.Int6`, etc.).

   You can find a description of the variable format on the [Sharp7.Rx readme](https://github.com/evopro-ag/Sharp7Reactive).

   If the connection cannot be established, try setting [CPU and Rack](https://github.com/fbarresi/Sharp7/wiki/Connection#rack-and-slot) with the `--cpu` and `--rack` parameters.

 - The program will establish a connection to the PLC and continuously display the values of the specified variables in a table format.
 
   Press `Ctrl + C` to exit.


### Command

`s7mon.exe <IP address> [variables] [OPTIONS]`

### Arguments

    <IP address>    IP address of S7
    [variables]     Variables to read from S7, like Db200.Int4.
                    For format description see https://github.com/evopro-ag/Sharp7Reactive

### Options
```
                     DEFAULT
    -h, --help                  Prints help information
    -c, --cpu        0          CPU MPI address of S7 instance.
                                See https://github.com/fbarresi/Sharp7/wiki/Connection#rack-and-slot.

    -r, --rack       0          Rack number of S7 instance.
                                See https://github.com/fbarresi/Sharp7/wiki/Connection#rack-and-slot.
```


### Example Invocation

```powershell
.\s7mon.exe 10.30.110.62 DB2050.Byte1 DB2050.Byte2.4 DB2050.Int6 DB2050.Real34 DB2050.String50.20
```

### Configure Cpu and Rack

Use `--cpu` and `--rack` parameters to specity the S7 instance to connect to. The required values depend on
the S7 you are using and it's configuration. You can find more information in the
[Sharp 7 docs](https://github.com/fbarresi/Sharp7/wiki/Connection#rack-and-slot).
